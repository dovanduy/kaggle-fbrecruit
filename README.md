==========

This repository contains the code I used to compete in the the Facebook recruiting challenge on Kaggle.  You can find details of the competition [here](http://www.kaggle.com/c/FacebookRecruiting/).  Since this was my first Kaggle competition, there aren't any original ideas in this code.  I used some of the utilities that Kaggle provided along with an EdgeRank algorithm described in the competition's forums.
